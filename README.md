# Cryptography-Key-Exchange-Algorithms

## Overview
Python implementations of foundational cryptographic algorithms, including Diffie-Hellman, ElGamal, and RSA, for secure communications. These include:

- **Diffie-Hellman**: A key exchange algorithm that allows two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel.
- **ElGamal**: A public-key cryptosystem that provides both encryption and digital signatures.
- **RSA**: A widely-used asymmetric cryptographic algorithm for secure data transmission.
